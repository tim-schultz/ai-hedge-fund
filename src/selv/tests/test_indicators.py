tests/test_indicators.py

These tests cover the *indicator layer*.  They serve a dual purpose:

1. **Functional verification** â€“ we make sure that both the
   vectorised helper (`add_indicators`) and the streaming helper
   (`StrategyState`) behave as expected on simple, deterministic input.

2. **Living documentation** â€“ each assertion is preceded by a short
   comment that explains *why* we expect the behaviour.  Treat the file
   as a guided tour of the indicator mechanics.
